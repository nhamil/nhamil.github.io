                        <a href="https://github.com/nhamil/quest-for-the-abacus">Spring 2017 Husky Games Project: Grand Kingdom: Quest for the Abacus</a><br>
                        This is a Java game built for the Husky Games Enterprise for Michigan Technological University. The team I was on consisted of 6 members. 
						I my roles on the team were to design artwork and to work with other team members to write the game. I developed a custom Java game engine
						for our game. We used a component-based game object approach similar to Unity3D's system.
